Criteria and Rules for Actions The system enforces several important rules and criteria to ensure proper land management, avoid conflicts, and maintain data integrity.
3.1 Government Scheme Application Criteria One Scheme per Land: Each land can only be enrolled in one government scheme at a time. If a scheme has already been applied, the system blocks any new scheme applications.

Eligibility: Lands must meet specific eligibility criteria for government schemes, such as the correct size and location of the land, or other conditions defined by the scheme.

Active Case/Loan Check: Before applying for a government scheme, the system checks for any active legal cases or loans. If the land has an active case or loan, no new scheme can be applied until the issue is resolved.

3.2 Land Transfer Restrictions No Active Case or Loan: A land cannot be transferred to a new owner if it is involved in an active legal case or has an outstanding loan. The system ensures that ownership transfer is blocked in these cases.

Case and Loan Verification: The system checks the status of cases and loans associated with the land before allowing the transfer. If there are active cases or loans, the transfer is not allowed until these are resolved.

3.3 Minor Details Update for Owners Normal Users: Can update only their own minor details (e.g., phone numbers, emails, or home addresses).

Admin Role: Admins can update both minor and major details for landowners, including personal and legal information.

No Update on Legal Information: Normal users cannot change any legal information, such as case statuses or loan details. These fields are only accessible to Court, Bank, or Admin users.

3.4 Role-Specific Permissions Each user role has specific permissions and restrictions based on their responsibilities:

Admin: Can view and edit all land records, apply government schemes, transfer ownership, and manage details for owners, cases, and loans.
